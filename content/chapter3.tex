In this thesis we will put use of the Metropolis-adjusted Langevin algorithm, in short MALA. This algorithm was first proposed by Besag ~\cite{BesagComment}
and later further developed by Roberts and Tweedie ~\cite{roberts1996exponential}. MALA is an implementation of the Makrov chain Monte Carlo, MCMC and converges to the searched posterior distribution $\pi(x)$.
We require a distribution proportional to 
$\pi(x), \quad \pi(x) \propto \tilde{\pi}(x)$

 and we need a formula to calculate the next 
proposed sample. The formula is given with 
$N(M_{n-1} + \frac{1}{2} h \nabla \log(\tilde{\pi}(M_{n-1})), h I_k)$
